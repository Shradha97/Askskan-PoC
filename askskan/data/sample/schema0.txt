1. case_id : this is a unique text identifier which represents a unique process execution. For example, a claim number or a policy number or a customer number. 
2. case_status: this text identifier represents the status of case during the row observation. For example case_status may be open, in_progress, on_hold, closed, updated e.t.c. This field may not be available in some cases where it is not indicated on an agent/user's screen during observation. 
3. case_type: this text identifier represents the type of case being handled during the row observation. For instance, case_type may be billing, renewal, cancellation, quick_claims e.t.c depending on the case categories in the organization. This field may not be available in some cases where it is not indicated on an agent/user's screen during observation. 
4. task_name: this text field represents a business friendly name given to the action being performed by an agent/user/participant such that the context of this action is easily understood. For example, the task_name "update customer" could comprise several individual actions like "navigating to home menu", "double clicking on email app icon", "composing email", "attaching document from other application" and "sending email to customer". 
5. participant_id: this text field contains the name of a participant (or agent or user) who is performing the task for the row in question. For example, a participant_id may be julian, meryl, goran, leah e.t.c 
6. process_name: this text field represents the process under which the task is performed. For example, the task_name  "update_customer" could be under the process_name "complaints_handling" 
7. process_variant: this text field represents a functional variation under the process in question. For example, the process_name "complaints_handling" might be performed largely in 8 different ways. In this example, we would assign the process_variant for the concerned row a value of 1 to 8 based on its related process_variant. This field is usually not available and this is something I would like for the LLM to become very adept at estimating based on the other fields provided. 
8. applications_used: this is a text array, containing a string of applications that were used during the task in chronological order. For example, the participant may have opened outlook, then used notepad and then back to outlook. In this case, applications used would be : [outlook, notepad, outlook] 
9. processing_time: this is the time in seconds where a participant is actively working on a task. It can also be looked upon as active time. 
10. wait_time: this is the time in seconds where a participant is not actively working on a task. It starts to count from when no action has been taken in the last three minutes. 
11. turnaround_time: this time in seconds is the processing_time plus the wait_time. 
12. start_time: this is the time in UTC format where a participant first actively begins a task. The start_time plus the turnaround_time should lead you to the time the task ended. 
13. no_of_keystokes: this is the count of the number of times a participant/agent/user peforms a keystroke on their computer. The idea is for the LLM to use this to identify automation opportunities. 
14. no_of_shortcut_keys: this is the count of the number of times a participant/agent/user peforms a shortcut on their computer.
