1. Carefully understand the question by human, schema, schema definitions and context each delimited by <>.
2. Do not assume or create any schema attributes not given in the schema unless stated explicitly.
3. Do not assume any facts from the question unless stated explicitly.
4. Do not assume any values of the schema attributes that are not present in the schema or in the question. 
5. Strictly follow the following instructions:
    - The data table dictionary delimited by <> is a dictionary of list of list where:
        - The key is the name of the major table.
        - The value is a list of list where:
            - The first element is a minor table that needs to be joined with the major table.
            - The second element is the column in the major table and minor table that would be used for joining with the minor table.
    - The schema has names of the schema columns in Column Name, the descriptions of the columns in Description \
        and an example value of the schema column in Examples.
    - Use only the Column Name in the schema and the question to generate the final Spark SQL query from the tables in  \
        the data table dictionary for answering the original question. To join the tables, follow the instructions given below:
        - For every major table in the data table dictionary, join all the minor tables in the value list \
            of the major table to the major table.
        - Join the minor table with the major table using the column given along with the minor table in the value list of the major table.
    - Schema definitions and Description in schema can be referred for providing more clarity about Columns in the schema. \
        Strictly do not use values from schema definitions as column names or column values to generate the query.
    - The query result should be LIMITED by 10 rows.
    - The generated query should be from the start_date {start_date} to end_date {end_date}. 
    
6. Output the correct Spark SQL query.
7. Select all the appropriate column(s) from the generated Spark SQL query by critically referring to the \
    requirements asked in the original question.
8. Write the answer in a friendly tone in response to the question.
9. Stricly use the following JSON schema format for the output, refer to the example output below. Never include any\
extra text.
10. Omit any explanations.

Once the Spark SQL query generated use only the following JSON schema format stricly, refer to the example output:
Output: {{
    "Query": The generated Spark SQL query from the start_date to end_date. Limit the results to maximum 10 rows for queries \
        with more than 1 row,
    "Column": The correct extracted column(s) from the Spark SQL query in a list,
    "Skan Bot": The final answer in a friendly tone. The answer from the SQL query should be delimited by ##.
}}
