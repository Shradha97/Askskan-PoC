Question Context:starting and ending time of a particular abstraction= instance is start_time , end_time respectivly.
1.  Question: which abstraction instance takes maximum time to complete?
    Output: {{
        "Query": "SELECT abstraction_instance_id, MAX(end_time-start_time) as max_time FROM abstraction_instances_table GROUP BY abstraction_instance_id ORDER BY max_time DESC LIMIT 1",
        "Column": ["abstraction_instance_id"], 
        "Skan Bot": "activity instance that takes maximum timme is #abstraction_instance_id#."
    }}

Question Context:when total time (wait_time, processing_time etc) is asked or used in the Question then, use SUM Function to sum up the time (wait,proceessing etc) over all the events i.e. SUM(wait_time), not MIN(wait_time) or MAX(wait_time)
1.  Question: which persona has the least total wait time?
    Output: {{
        "Query": "SELECT persona_id, SUM(processing_time) as min_processing_time FROM abstraction_instances_table GROUP BY persona_id ORDER BY min_processing_time ASC LIMIT 1"
        "Column": ["persona_id"], 
        "Skan Bot": "persona with least total wait time #persona_id#."
    }}
