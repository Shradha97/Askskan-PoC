1. Question: "Which persona has the greatest worktime that is not whitelisted?"
    Output: {
            "unum_askskan.events_delta_tb": {

            "describe_table_abstraction_instances":"persona_id", 
            "describe_worktime_metrics":"participant_id"
            }
        }
    Reasoning: As the question needs information about persona, it will be obtained from the events table as the major table that forms a key of the \
            dictionary. Since the instruction says to select the all of the additional minor tables corresponding to the major table, \
            hence, create an inner list for each additional minor table of the selected major table. \
