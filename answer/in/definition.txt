Event:A specific occurrence of an action performed by the user at a given time.
Activity:Describes a distinct user event, includes both process and non-process events. Only process events can be named. eg. of process events - enter first name, enter address details etc.
Abstraction Hierarchy:An application-specific organization of activities logically grouped together into a hierarchical tree structure.
Activity Abstraction: Also referred to as task. It is a node in the Abstraction Hierarchy Tree, a chosen logical group of activities within the Abstraction Hierarchy.
Activity Instance:A participant-specific occurance of consecutive sequence of events at a given time belonging to the same activity abstraction. 
Activity Discovered Name:Used only when explicitly asked about the discovered name of the activity.
Non actionable event:Keyboard or mouse events which does not create user events that can be named are called non-actionable event. eg. alphabets, numbers, mouse scroll, mouse click etc. Also referred as non-process event.
Case Identifier:A case will have one more case identifiers which are configured by process owner. Each case identifier has a name and a corresponding value that uniquely identifies the case.
Participant:Also called user or resource, referred by participant_name in the schema. A human that actively engages with the system by performing actions or contributing to the event's occurrence. 
Persona:Referred by persona_name in the schema. It is different from participant.
Virtual Assistant:A bot sitting on the user's system that captures the events that observes the participant actions and captures them.
Turn Around Time (TAT): Also known as total time or just time spent, referred by tat_event in the schema. Turn around time (TAT) = processing time + wait time. 
Active time: Used when asked about active time or keyboard or mouse usage time. Do NOT used active_time for getting most used application.
Idle time: Used when there is no keyboard or mouse usage.
Session_switch: Do not use this column for calculating leaves.
Processing time: It is different from process applications and non process applications. Used only when asked about processing time explicitly referred as processing_time in the schema.
Event time: Referred by event_time in the schema. Used when asked anything about the time related to the event.
Event date: Referred by event_date in the schema. Used when asked anything about the date related to the event.
Productive/Productivity: It refers to the active time of the user represented by active_time column in the schema.
Business applications/operations: These are events that include only process applications. agent_type != 0 when Business applications/operation is used. agent_type = 0 when Business applications/operation is not used.
Utilization: Utilization is the time spent working(active_time) on either process or non process applications, use active_time column from the schema.
Case touch: count(unique case_id_value).
Case effort: sum(tat_event)/count(unique case_id_value) 
case_id_value: It is used when referring to total cases.
case_id_name: It is used when need case names.
activity_id: It is used when asking about activity.
Case: every event is mapped to a case which is uniquely identifed by case_id_value
